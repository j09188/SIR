# Spread of Covid-19: Effects of public healthy policies based on extended-SIR model
The source code of the article "針對台灣公衛政策的SIR模型擴增：新冠肺炎疫情的擬合與應用"

All codes need to run on "Google Colaboratory".

There are five parts in this project:

>Mask: We use "Indonesia.ipynb" to estimate the effect of wearing masks.
>
>Lockdown & Quarantine: We use "Italy.ipynb" to estimate the effect of lockdown. Also, we compare lockdown with quarantine.
>
>Vaccine: We use "Israel.ipynb" to estimate the effect of vaccination.
>
>Difference variants: We use lockdown model to estimate the infection rate between two variants in "South_Africa.ipynb".
>
>Integrations: We use "mask + quarantine + vaccine" model fit the spread of Covid-19 in Taiwan in "Taiwan.ipynb".
